I recently worked on a fraud payment detection model where I tackled real-world transaction data to build a high-performing ML model for identifying fraudulent behavior.

## üîç Project Highlights:

1) Analyzed over 5 million+ transaction records.

2) Built an XGBoost classification model without SMOTE, handling imbalance 3) using scale_pos_weight.

4) Achieved an impressive ROC-AUC score of 95.6%, with fine-tuned threshold control.

5) Used Precision-Recall Curve, Confusion Matrix, and ROC Curve for performance evaluation.

6) Identified key fraud indicators like transaction type, amount spikes, and account balance behavior.

## Also included:

Confusion matrix, ROC-AUC & PR curves.

Real-time fraud detection suggestions for deployment.

## üõ† Tools Used:
Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost, Statistics, Scikit-learn
